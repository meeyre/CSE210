/*
EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS:
I felt like the prompts were good, but when I was testing my program I didn't feel like answering the
prompts was actually journaling. So, I added some extra elements to my Entry class, so in each entry the 
user would need to respond to 3 extra questons about events in the morning, noon, and night, so that
they could actually doccument their day a bit. I then modified the Save, Load, and Display functions so 
that the new responses and static prompts would be displayed correctly along with the original prompt.
